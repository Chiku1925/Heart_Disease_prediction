# Heart_Disease_prediction
## Overview
This project develops a logistic regression model to predict the likelihood of heart disease based on a set of patient features. The primary goal is to provide a tool for early detection and risk assessment, which can be valuable for healthcare professionals in diagnosing and preventing heart disease.
### Key Components:
-Data Preprocessing: The dataset is cleaned and prepared by addressing missing values, encoding categorical variables, and normalizing numerical features. This step ensures that the data is in the best possible format for model training.

-Logistic Regression Model: Logistic regression is employed to model the relationship between patient characteristics and the probability of heart disease. This technique is chosen for its interpretability and efficiency in binary classification tasks.

-Model Evaluation: The model's performance is assessed using the accuracy score, which measures the proportion of correctly predicted instances. This evaluation helps in understanding the model's effectiveness and reliability in predicting heart disease.

The project aims to enhance the ability to identify individuals at risk of heart disease, thereby supporting timely medical intervention and promoting better health outcomes.
